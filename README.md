# Project 1
## Knights Tour GUI
The Knights Tour is the first dive into working with the Java Swing GUI interface.

## Objective

Project 1 is the first time using Java's built in Java Swing GUI components. This project provided insight on how GUIs are built and made to be interacted with. This program specifically shows a preset set of instructions on screen that identify a [Knights Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour).

## Running the Program

In this directory, there is 1 file that can be executed. You can run the packaged (.jar) file through the command line.

### Running the .jar file through command line:

In a command line, after navigating to the correct directory, type the following commands:
java -jar KnightsTourGUI.jar

## Using the Program

To use the program, you must enter the full directory of the testDir.txt file. This testDir.txt file is a preset set of instructions for the program to read. After entering the directory, press enter, and go to the drop down menu to select a tour. After pressing start, it will then begin the tour if it is valid. There are options to control the speed, color, and other variables within the program.
